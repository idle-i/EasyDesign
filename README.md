## Overview

EasyDesign is an open source iOS framework for Swift that provides custom views that inherit from the standard UIKit views. It is a powerful framework that can help make the process of creating a user interface much easier and faster!

Each custom class inherits from the UIKit base class. This means that they can still be configured as regular UIKit views, but in addition, you have a few useful properties and methods that can help you through the UI creation process.
